# home_screen_codes
Home screen widget for Android and iOS used to find your barcodes and QR codes quickly

## Motivation
I have a barcode card for my climbing üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è club. I was too bored to take it with me each time, so I took a picture of the barcode. Then I was too bored to open my gallery app to find my barcode picture. Then I thought, hey I should make a home screen widget for that, but let's make it with flutter because it's more fun. Now I also use it to have quick access to some QR code (my Wi-Fi network QR code for example)

## How it works
All the logic is made with Dart, and therefore can be common to Android and iOS. The home screen widget does two things, it reads/displays data, and it sends events to Dart code, in order to update the data. This communication process is simplified by the use of a plugin name [home_widget](https://pub.dev/packages/home_widget).
